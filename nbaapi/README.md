// This is a NBA Player Search app Using the balldontlie api
// I used the api to search for nba players by name
When you enter the first and last name of a player, the application will pull the players: Name, Team, Position, and their hieght if its available from the api.Then the results will be to the user.
I used HTML/CSS/ and jQuery for my project

# Future versions will include a nba news headline carousel and will have more animation.
